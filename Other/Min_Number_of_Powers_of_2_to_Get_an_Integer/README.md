Every number can be described in powers of 2. For example, `29 = 2^0 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4`. Given an int `n`, return minimum number of additions and subtractions of `2^i` to get `n`.

# Example 1:
```
Input: 15
Output: 2
Explanation: 2^4 - 2^0 = 16 - 1 = 15
```

# Example 2:
```
Input: 8
Output: 1
```

# Example 3:
```
Input: 0
Output: 0
```
